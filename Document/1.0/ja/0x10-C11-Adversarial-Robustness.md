# C11 敵対的堅牢性と攻撃耐性 (Adversarial Robustness & Attack Resistance)

## 管理目標

Ensure that AI systems remain reliable, privacy-preserving, and abuse-resistant when facing evasion, inference, extraction, or poisoning attacks. These controls cover model alignment testing, adversarial hardening, privacy attack resistance, model theft deterrence, and security adaptation for autonomous agents.

Generic application security controls (configuration management, secret and key management, signed artifacts, audit logging, change control, transport security, generic anti-automation rate limiting) are covered by ASVS v5 (V11, V13, V14, V15, V16) and are not repeated here. Logging of AI security events, AI incident response planning, and human-oversight escalation are covered by AISVS C13 and C14. Inversion-specific (C11.4) and extraction-specific (C11.5) throttling controls do not substitute for generic API rate limiting (ASVS v5 V2.4) or orchestration runtime budgets (C9.1). C11.8 (agent self-review) covers AI-augmented review of proposed agent actions and protection of that review mechanism from prompt-injection bypass; the deterministic runtime gate that blocks high-impact agent actions is governed by C9.2 and C9.7.

| **11.1.1** | **Verify that** refusal and safe-completion guardrails are enforced to prevent the model from generating disallowed content categories. | 1 |
| **11.1.2** | **Verify that** an alignment test suite (red-team prompts, jailbreak probes, disallowed-content checks) is version-controlled and run on every model update or release. | 1 |
| **11.1.3** | **Verify that** an automated evaluator measures harmful-content rate and flags regressions beyond a defined threshold. | 2 |
| **11.1.4** | **Verify that** alignment and safety training procedures (e.g., RLHF, constitutional AI, or equivalent) are documented and reproducible. | 2 |
| **11.1.5** | **Verify that** alignment evaluation includes assessments for evaluation awareness, where the model may behave differently when it detects it is being tested versus deployed. | 3 |

Detect and deter unauthorized model cloning through API abuse. Rate limiting, query-pattern analysis, and watermarking are recommended defenses.

| # | 説明 | レベル |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **11.5.1** | **Verify that** inference endpoints enforce per-principal and global rate limits sized to the extraction threat model, and not solely as a generic API throttle. | 1 |

| **11.6.2** | **Verify that** anomaly-detection thresholds are tuned on representative clean and adversarial validation sets and that the false-positive rate is measured and documented. | 2 |
| **11.6.3** | **Verify that** inputs flagged as anomalous trigger gating actions (blocking, capability degradation, or human review) appropriate to the risk level. | 2 |
| **11.6.4** | **Verify that** detection methods are periodically stress-tested with current adversarial techniques, including adaptive attacks designed to evade the specific detectors in use. | 3 |

| **11.7.3** | **Verify that** rollback procedures exist for policy changes and are tested to confirm they restore the previous policy state. | 2 |
| **11.7.4** | **Verify that** threat-detection sensitivity can be adjusted based on risk context (e.g., elevated threat level, incident response) with appropriate authorization. | 3 |

## C11.8 エージェントセキュリティ自己評価 (Agent Security Self-Assessment)

For agentic AI systems, supplement deterministic policy gates (C9.2, C9.7) with AI-augmented review of proposed actions, and protect that review mechanism from adversarial bypass.

| # | 説明 | レベル |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **11.8.1** | **Verify that** agentic systems include an AI-augmented review of planned high-risk actions before execution (e.g., a secondary model, structured self-review step, or ensemble-of-judges check) that operates in addition to and not in place of the deterministic policy gate in C9.7.1. | 2 |
| **11.8.2** | **Verify that** the AI-augmented review mechanism in 11.8.1 is protected against manipulation by adversarial inputs, so that the review step cannot be overridden or bypassed through prompt injection or instruction smuggling in agent context. | 2 |

| **11.9.4** | **Verify that** self-modifications are reversible and subject to integrity verification, so that rollback to a known-good state is possible and can be confirmed. | 2 |
| **11.9.5** | **Verify that** self-modification scope is bounded (e.g., maximum change magnitude, rate limits on updates, prohibited modification targets) to prevent runaway or adversarially induced changes. | 3 |
| **11.9.6** | **Verify that** when safety violation data (blocked inputs, filtered outputs, flagged hallucinations) is used as training signal for model improvement, the feedback pipeline includes integrity verification, poisoning detection, and human review gates to prevent adversarial manipulation of the improvement mechanism. | 3 |

| # | 説明 | レベル |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **11.10.1** | **Verify that** adversarial robustness evaluations for security-relevant classifiers are stratified by meaningful input subgroups (e.g., language register, content category), with per-subgroup false-negative rates under adversarial conditions measured and flagged when deviating from aggregate rates beyond a defined threshold. | 2 |
| **11.10.2** | **Verify that** inference endpoints for security-relevant classifiers (e.g., abuse detection, fraud scoring) include monitoring that accounts for query patterns indicative of bias probing, such as systematic variation along a single input dimension (e.g., demographic, linguistic, stylistic) while other dimensions remain constant, and alert when such patterns are detected. | 3 |
| **11.10.3** | **Verify that** where bias-based evasion is identified as a material threat, adversarial hardening (e.g., adversarial training with per-subgroup loss constraints, ensemble diversity across training distributions) incorporates explicit subgroup robustness requirements, and that per-subgroup robustness metrics are verified not to regress across model releases. | 3 |
